# Python-Stopwatch
With inspiration from BroCode, I was able to build this python GUI stopwatch. 
(All Credit goes to BroCode's python tutorial)

Using a built Python PyQt5 GUI, it displays a stopwatch that can start the timer, stop the timer, and reset the timer.

By all means, you may change the code to your liking.
